Jhota Checker

Jhota Checker is a fun AI-powered web application that analyzes a user's physical strength, lifestyle, and personality traits to determine whether they qualify as a “Jhota” — a slang term for a heavily built, strong, dominant young man.

The app uses Google Gemini API to generate a Jhota Score and provide personalized feedback.
